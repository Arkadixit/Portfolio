            data-description="A passion project that allowed me to explore game development using the Unity engine. This mini game started as a weekend experiment and evolved into a polished prototype featuring custom gameplay mechanics, engaging level design, and satisfying player feedback systems. The development process covered the full game creation pipeline: conceptualizing the core game loop, implementing player controls and physics, designing levels that progressively introduce new challenges, creating visual effects and animations, integrating sound design, and optimizing performance for smooth gameplay. Working in Unity deepened my understanding of game architecture patterns, component-based design, and the importance of iteration in creating fun experiences. The project also involved learning C# scripting patterns specific to game development."

            data-description="An educational deep dive into the mathematical foundations of neural networks by implementing everything from first principles in C++. Rather than using existing frameworks, this project built a neural network library from the ground up, including matrix operations, activation functions, loss computation, and backpropagation. The implementation started with simple perceptrons, then expanded to multi-layer networks, convolutional layers, and various optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop. Writing in C++ forced careful consideration of memory management, computational efficiency, and numerical stability. The project culminated in training models on classic datasets like MNIST, achieving respectable accuracy while truly understanding every computation happening during training. This foundational knowledge proved invaluable for debugging and optimizing models in high-level frameworks."

            data-description="A comprehensive home server project that transformed spare hardware into a powerful self-hosted platform for media streaming, game servers, and personal cloud services. The project involved setting up a Linux server environment, configuring containerized applications with Docker, implementing proper networking with reverse proxies and SSL certificates, and ensuring security through firewalls and access controls. Services include a media server for movies and music streaming to any device, game servers for hosting multiplayer sessions with friends, file synchronization and backup solutions, and monitoring dashboards for system health. The project emphasized learning production-level DevOps practices: automated deployments, proper logging, backup strategies, and maintaining uptime. It's become an essential part of my home infrastructure, serving family and friends reliably."
